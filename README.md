Tech Returners want to improve the conversations we have with our cohorts such that we want to really understand which jobs match our cohort
members.

Your task is to write a function that accepts a list of job characteristics and a list of individual skills/characteristics. It should use those two
different sets of characteristics to provide a match score between 0 and 100. Where 100 is the ideal match and 0 indicates definitely do NOT
show this person that job.

An example list of job characteristics might be (please create others to test out your code):

* <b>Job A characteristics:</b> “remote” “flexible working hours”
* <b>Job B characteristics:</b> “office based two days per week” “react developer”
* <b>Individual A skills/characteristics:</b> “wants to work remote” “react experience” “looking for frontend”
* <b>Individual B skills/characteristics:</b> “backend developer” “cloud experience” “AWS certified
